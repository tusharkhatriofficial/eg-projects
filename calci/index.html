            As part of my EG project, I developed a fully-functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The development process has been a gratifying experience that enabled me to acquire practical knowledge and useful skills. With HTML, I structured the layout of the calculator and developed the input buttons that enable users to perform calculations. CSS allowed me to customize the styling of the calculator and enhance its visual appeal. Using JavaScript, I was able to build the calculator's functionality and create a seamless user experience.
